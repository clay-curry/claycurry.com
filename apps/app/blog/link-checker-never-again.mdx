# The Last Link-Checker I Will Ever Build

<Summary>
This article is a warning to anyone fed up with broken links. After recently 
building my third, I can attest: there are much bigger fish to fry. Do anything, literally 
anything, other than building *yet another* link-checker.
</Summary>


## Learning Lessons

Allocating enough energy to build 3 link-checkers produces two realizations: 

1. there are such things a impossibly difficult problems[^1],
2. gray is the cost of black and white where black and white actually count

The lesson is clear, “broken” is not a binary property of a URL. It is a cosmic 
feeling, flowing with the tides and seasons, to say that piece of UX does or does not
achieve its purpose.

Consider these four criteria:

- **Semantic validity**: A page may return 200 but contain irrelevant or incorrect content.

- **Policy validity**: Teams hardly ever reach consensus on what counts as relevant.

- **Strategically validity**: In a business startup, a perfectly working website often signals something much deeper is broken.
  
- **Temporal validity**: Links fail transiently (timeouts, rate limits, deployments) and later succeed. does your business require.

## What Now?

So what do you do?

1. Pick one or two criteria and track your success rate over time.
2. Ignore recommendation 1, for links with "Add to Cart" or "Buy Now" in the anchor text.


A good citizen mows their neighbor's lawn, a helpful soul returns lost wallets, and a wise person 
never builds their own link-checker, at least without starring mine.
