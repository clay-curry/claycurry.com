## Salutations

Dear Seattle.

Before saying farewell, I want to say thank you. For the privilege of riding 14 months under your wing. Your training wheels came in handy, as I learned how to pedal on my own. I am fortunate for the memories, the learning, and the growth:

- learning to estimate and communicate, 
- staying humble and embracing growth, 
- tactically exercising balance and imbalance
- discovering meaningful work through relationships.

Most of all, I learned how badly I need to buy a real camera.

it's time to hack something on my own. (if i'm lucky, with a group of solid people far more talented than me). SEA, this is my farewell.

SF, I'm all in – LFG.
