## Judgment Day

Today is my last day at Amazon. Half my team was let go, even my manager.
The survivors say the reduction impacted our org harder than others.

## What happened?

Around 3 A.M.local time, the entire company received an email from Amazon's SVP of HR – explaining 
our options:

1. transfer internally and stay at Amazon
2. use 90 days of PTO and leave Amazon


## Why leave?

Logically, option 2 seemed like the only reasonable choice. 

One of the below two cases must be true: 

1. Calibration problem

You believed your work was among the most important for the business, until a 
workforce reduction refuted that. How does Option 1 address your calibration 
problem? 

2. Visibility / Credit problem:

Your work was important, but someone else took credit and gave you smelly eggs.

How does Option 1 create more visibility on your work? 

===

Ultimately: both choices feel like career limbo - the first circle of hell. The
truth is, I feel lucky for the wake-up call. A huge reason why I stayed with 
the same team was the perceived job security. Our core product was a tier
1 service so critical an outage would produce a measurable drop in orders. So 
what? Other engineers were equally capable of patching a fix. I was redundant
without something unique to contribute.

It does no good to linger in limbo. There is plenty of more hell to see!

it's time to hack something on my own. (if i'm lucky, with a group of solid people far more talented than me). SEA, this is my farewell.

SF, I'm all in – LFG.
