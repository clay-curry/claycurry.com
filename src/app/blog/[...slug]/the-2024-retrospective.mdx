It never ceases to energize me with bottomless fascination reflecting on the epiphanies that gave birth to 
the (first) digital age immediately following World War II. I say this only because I should like to think the lessons 
of this history offer some guidance in paving the next generation of programming languages facing the challenges of distributed logic,
the limitations of large language models, and the vulnerabilities unique to the front-end cloud.

I must give credit to the creators of v0 for helping me place the historical setting of our discussion.

If history serves us with any lesson suggesting how we should ask what the future holds for computer 
programming, its that any angle risks supposing we should find simplicity 
when all we can have is nuance. I regret not being able to give credit to whom it is greatly due for recognizing the ill-foundedness of a distinction even existing between
"a computer programmer" and "not a computer programmer."

## Origins of Computer Programming

 

      seems worthwhile of time and energy only when you consider 
      (thanks to Lovelace) the unfathomable number 
      things you might accomplish you could build (thanks to Turing) the small fraction of
      useful machines. 


The central question at bleeding-edge of programming language design asks how computer 
      programmers ought to command fleets of machines to execute distributed logic to best 
      facilitate functionality relevant to place in history. 


to recall that computer programming predates computers by over a century
