# Special Thanks

True to the idea that creativity often builds upon others’ work, this portfolio website 
simply would not exist without the work of many open source contributers. 

To begin, I must acknowledge [Enji.dev](https://enji.dev)'s portfolio for communicating the
impact of intentionally selecting color, animations, and vector graphics coinciding with a
page theme. A blog is for connecting the dots. A project aggregate components into a useful 
form. Beyond that, my portfolio showcases several interactions coming directly from his own.

Much of his website drew inspiration from Theodorus Clarence’s portfolio at [theodorusclarence.com](theodorusclarence.com). 

## Process
My workflow and this project are powered by various open-source tools generously provided by the following companies:

	•	Vercel – Hosting infrastructure for this site, and championing innovative programming languages for independent developers and small companies.
	•	Microsoft – For VS Code, TypeScript, and numerous open-source projects that have greatly enriched the development community.
	•	Meta – For React, JSX, and related front-end tools.
	•	Oven.sh – For the insight that while JavaScript isn’t always ideal for developers, it remains the right choice for the browser.

Open-Source Projects
Gratitude goes to the contributors, maintainers, and communities who developed and maintain the tools that power this site. Key projects include:

	•	Bun – Demonstrating the complexities of framework compilation.
	•	Linux – The open-source OS supporting my development environment.
	•	VS Code – A code editor that simplifies development.
	•	Cursor – Highlighting the importance of continued VS Code development.
	•	Webpack – Pioneering code-splitting, hot-module-reloading, and module federation in front-end development.
	•	Turbopack – Bringing Webpack’s features with improved native performance.
	•	swc – For compiling TypeScript with high efficiency.
	•	React – Making declarative UI possible with the right abstractions.
	•	Next.js – Introducing server components, structured file-based routing, and declarative data-fetching to React.
	•	Tailwind – Streamlining CSS for modern development.

## Proprietary Services
Occassionally, content with sufficiently high value simply cannot be created without the need for a paywall.

	•	FrontendMasters – For sponsoring Sean Larkin’s work on Webpack and offering training at an accessible price.
  •	Leetcode – For sponsoring Sean Larkin’s work on Webpack and offering training at an accessible price.

Many unmentioned projects inspired this portfolio but enumerating them all is simply not worth it.
