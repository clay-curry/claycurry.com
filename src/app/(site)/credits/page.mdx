# Credits

Most of all, to [enji.dev](https://enji.dev/) for open-sourcing his portfolio so I could migrate it to React 19 / Next.js 15 app router. A lot of things on his website was inspired Theodorus Clarence's portfolio at [theodorusclarence.com](https://theodorusclarence.com/).

## Companies
For investing in open-source software that make development safer, easier, and more stable.
  * [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) - for providing the infrastructure to host this site and paving the next generation of programming languages for indies and small companies. 
  * [Microsoft](https://microsoft.com) - for investing in VS Code, TypeScript, and other countless open-source projects that have made the world a better place.
  * [Meta](https://facebook.com) - for React, JSX, and other frontend .
  * [FrontendMasters](https://frontendmasters.com/) - for paying Sean Larkin to talk about Webpack, then sharing it at a reasonable price.
  * [Oven.sh](https://oven.sh/) - for making me realize that JavaScript is the wrong language for the developer, but the right language for the browser.

## Projects
All of the open source contributors, maintainers, and communities that concieved, built, and freely shared the tools powering this site. To name a few:

  - [Linux](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/) - for the open-source operating system that powers my laptop.
  - [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - for the open-source code editor that makes writing code... well, easier.
  - [Cursor](https://cursor.sh/) - for making Microsoft hire more VS Code developers.
  - [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) - for bringing code splitting, hot-module-reloading, and module federation to front-end.
  - [Turbopack](https://turbo.build/pack) - for being Webpack with native performance.
  - [swc](https://swc.rs/) - for compiling massive amounts of TypeScript with native performance
  - [React](https://reactjs.org/) - for showing that general-purpose UI works in a declarative way but only with the right abstractions.
