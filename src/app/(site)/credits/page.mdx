# Special Thanks

This portfolio website would not exist without the work of many open source contributers. 

<br />

I must acknowledge [Enji Kusnadi](https://enji.dev) and [Theodorus Clarence](theodorusclarence.com)
for open sourcing their portfolios, allowing me to quickly repurpose their work. 

## Development Process
Gratitude goes to the contributors, maintainers, and communities who developed and maintain the tools that power this site. Key projects include:
<br />

- [Bun]() – Demonstrating the complexities of framework compilation.
- [Linux]() – The open-source OS supporting my development environment.
- [Visual]() Studio Code – A code editor that simplifies development.
- [Cursor]() – Highlighting the importance of continued VS Code development.
- [Webpack]() – Pioneering code-splitting, hot-module-reloading, and module federation in front-end development.
- [Turbopack]() – Bringing Webpack’s features with improved native performance.
- [swc]() – For compiling TypeScript with high efficiency.
- [React]() – Making declarative UI possible with the right abstractions.
- [Next.js]() – Introducing server components, structured file-based routing, and declarative data-fetching to React.
- [Tailwind]() – Streamlining CSS for modern development.

## Proprietary Services

Though I generally build using my own artifacts and learn from freely available quality sources, for sake of convenience, I enlisted
three companies to assist with hosting my portfolio.
<br />

- [Github]() – For sponsoring hosting the repository of [source code](https://github.com/claycurry-com) where anyone to browse.
- [Vercel]() – For providing the content delivery network distributing the site with low latency at scale.
- [Amazon Web Services]() - For hosting physical infrastructure on behalf of Vercel.

Many unmentioned projects inspired this portfolio but enumerating them all is simply not worth it.
