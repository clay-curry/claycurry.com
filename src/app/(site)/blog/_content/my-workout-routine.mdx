# My Workout Routine

<Summary>

A comprehensive breakdown of my **4-day training split** designed for building strength and maintaining overall fitness. This routine balances pushing, pulling, and leg movements for well-rounded development.

</Summary>

## Philosophy

My approach to fitness is built on three core principles:

1. **Consistency > Intensity** — Show up regularly, even when motivation is low.
2. **Progressive overload** — Gradually increase weight, reps, or volume
3. **Recovery is training** — Sleep and nutrition are non-negotiable.

## Weekly Schedule

Here's how I structure my training week:

| Day | Focus | Duration |
|-----|-------|----------|
| Monday | Upper Body Push | 60 min |
| Tuesday | Lower Body | 75 min |
| Wednesday | Rest / Cardio | 30 min |
| Thursday | Upper Body Pull | 60 min |
| Friday | Full Body / Accessories | 45 min |
| Weekend | Active Recovery | Variable |

## Day 1: Upper Body Push

Primary muscles: *chest, shoulders, triceps*

### Main Lifts

```
Bench Press: 4 sets × 6-8 reps
Overhead Press: 4 sets × 8-10 reps
Incline Dumbbell Press: 3 sets × 10-12 reps
```

### Accessory Work

- Lateral raises: 3 × 15
- Tricep pushdowns: 3 × 12
- Face pulls: 3 × 15

## Day 2: Lower Body

Primary muscles: *quadriceps, hamstrings, glutes*

### Main Lifts

```
Squat: 5 sets × 5 reps
Romanian Deadlift: 4 sets × 8-10 reps
Bulgarian Split Squat: 3 sets × 10 each leg
```

### Accessory Work

- Leg press: 3 × 12
- Leg curls: 3 × 12

> **Pro tip**: Don't skip leg day. Your posterior chain supports everything else you do.

## Day 3: Upper Body Pull

Primary muscles: *back, biceps, rear delts*

### Main Lifts

```
Deadlift: 4 sets × 5 reps
Weighted Pull-ups: 4 sets × 6-8 reps

```

- Reverse flyes: 3 × 15

## Nutrition Guidelines

Proper nutrition fuels performance and recovery:

1. **Protein**: 0.8-1g per pound of bodyweight
2. **Carbohydrates**: Time around workouts for energy
3. **Fats**: Essential for hormone production
4. **Hydration**: Minimum 3L water daily

### Sample Pre-Workout Meal

- 1 cup oatmeal with banana
- 2 whole eggs + 2 egg whites
- Black coffee

### Sample Post-Workout Meal

- 6oz chicken breast or salmon
- 1 cup rice or sweet potato
- Steamed vegetables
