# README - claycurry.com

<Summary>

This portfolio was built to stay out of the way and let the work shine for technical folks: scientisits, mathematicians, 
engineers, and developers. It leverages modern web technologies, particularly **Next.js 16**, **Tailwind CSS**, and 
**MDX** for content authoring. It serves as both a professional showcase and a playground for experimenting with modern 
web technologies.

</Summary>

## Project Overview

This site was created to accomplish several goals:

1. **Professional presence** — A central hub for my work and experience
2. **Technical blog** — Share knowledge and document learnings
3. **Design experimentation** — Test UI patterns and interactions
4. **Performance benchmark** — Maintain excellent Core Web Vitals

> "Design is not just what it looks like and feels like. Design is how it works." — Steve Jobs

## Technical Stack

### Core Technologies

| Technology | Purpose | Version |
|------------|---------|---------|
| Next.js | React framework | 16.x |
| Tailwind CSS | Styling | 4.x |
| MDX | Content authoring | 3.x |
| TypeScript | Type safety | 5.x |
| Vercel | Hosting & deployment | — |

### Key Features

- **App Router** — Leveraging Next.js 16's app directory structure
- **Server Components** — Optimized rendering strategy
- **Dark Mode** — System preference detection with manual toggle
- **MDX Blog** — Write posts in Markdown with React components
- **View Counter** — Track page popularity with serverless functions

```

## Design Principles

### Visual Hierarchy

The design follows a clear information hierarchy:

- **Primary**: Name, title, key actions
- **Secondary**: Section headers, navigation
- **Tertiary**: Body content, metadata

### Color System

```css
/* Light mode */
--background: #ffffff;
--foreground: #171717;
--accent: #3b82f6;

/* Dark mode */
--background: #0a0a0a;
--foreground: #ededed;
--accent: #60a5fa;
```

### Typography

- **Headings**: Bold, tight tracking
- **Body**: Regular weight, comfortable line height
- **Code**: Monospace, slightly reduced size

## Performance Goals

Core Web Vitals targets:

- **LCP** (Largest Contentful Paint): < 2.5s
- **FID** (First Input Delay): < 100ms
- **CLS** (Cumulative Layout Shift): < 0.1

### Optimization Strategies

1. Image optimization with `next/image`
2. Font subsetting and preloading
3. Route prefetching for navigation
4. Static generation where possible

## Development Workflow

### Getting Started

```bash
# Install dependencies
bun install

# Start development server
bun run dev

# Build for production
bun run build
```

### Code Quality

- **Biome** for linting and formatting
- **TypeScript** for type checking
- **Conventional commits** for version history

## Future Roadmap

Planned improvements:

- [ ] Add cookie support for view counting
- [ ] Write an article introducing Laplace and Fourier Transform
- [ ] Add LaTeX support for technical posts
- [ ] Add MDX support for rendering code blocks
- [ ] Add table of contents for blog posts
  - [ ] Allow users to choose to show / hide table of contents
  - [ ] Construct table of contents based on style, theme, color
- [ ] Implement RSS feed
- [ ] Implement SEO
- [ ] Add search functionality
- [ ] Create project showcase section
- [ ] Add reading time estimates
- [ ] Improve accessibility (WCAG AA)
